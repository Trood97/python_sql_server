For many, SQL is the "meat and potatoes" of data analysis

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing data in a relational database.

so each person has his or her own schema. Schemas are defined by usernames, so if your username is databass3000,
all of the tables you upload will be stored under the databass3000 schema.

SELECT indicates which columns you'd like to view, and FROM identifies the table that they live in.

(Remember that when referencing tables, the table names have to be preceded by the name of user who uploaded it.)

You might have noticed that the SELECT and `FROM' commands are capitalized. This isn't actually necessary
